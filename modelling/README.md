## 🔧 Module Descriptions

### `app.py` - Streamlit User Interface
The main entry point for the application. Contains:
- Data upload and configuration UI
- Model selection interface
- Results visualization and dashboards
- Download functionality

**Key Function:** `main()` - Streamlit application orchestrator

---

### `models.py` - Custom Regression Models
Contains all custom model implementations:

1. **`CustomConstrainedRidge`** - Ridge regression with coefficient sign constraints
   - Supports L2 regularization
   - Adam optimizer option
   - Non-negative/non-positive feature constraints

2. **`ConstrainedLinearRegression`** - Linear regression with sign constraints
   - No L2 penalty
   - Gradient descent with constraints
   - Adam optimizer support

3. **`RecursiveLeastSquaresRegressor`** - Sequential coefficient updating
   - Standard RLS with configurable forgetting factor
   - Respects positive/negative sign constraints defined in the UI
   - Supports optional coefficient history tracking for diagnostics
   - Provides incremental `update()` method for streaming data

4. **`StackedInteractionModel`** - Group-specific coefficient modeling
   - Creates interaction terms for each group
   - Dummy variable encoding
   - Extracts per-group coefficients

5. **`StatsMixedEffectsModel`** - Wrapper for statsmodels MixedLM
   - Random effects per group
   - Fallback to LinearRegression if mixed effects fail
   - Minimum group size filtering

---

### `utils.py` - Helper & Ensemble Functions

**Helper Functions:**
- `safe_mape()` - MAPE calculation with outlier protection

**Ensemble Functions:**
- `build_weighted_ensemble_model()` - Exponential weighting based on MAPE
- `create_ensemble_model_from_results()` - Creates ensembles from CV results with filtering

---

### `pipeline.py` - Main Modeling Pipeline

**Key Function:** `run_model_pipeline()`

Orchestrates the entire modeling workflow:

1. **Data Splitting**
   - Groups data by specified keys
   - Filters groups by Y-variable share
   - Creates train/test splits for evaluation
   - Optional holdout period keeps the most recent observations for out-of-sample validation

2. **Cross-Validation**
   - K-fold CV with adaptive fold selection (2-5 folds based on sample size)
   - Separate processing for regular vs. stacked models
   - Standardization and log transformation support

3. **Model Training**
   - Trains multiple model types per group
   - Handles custom constrained models
   - Tracks coefficients and metrics

4. **Ensemble Creation** (Optional)
   - Filters models by R², MAPE, MAE, sign constraints
   - Weighted averaging of coefficients

**Returns:**
- `results_df` - Cross-validation results with metrics
- `preds_df` - Predictions for all folds
- `ensemble_df` - Ensemble model results (if enabled)

## 🔍 Code Quality Improvements

This refactoring addresses several issues from the original monolithic file:

### Fixed Issues:
✅ **Removed Duplicates**
- Eliminated duplicate `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')`
- Removed duplicate module docstring
- Consolidated `safe_mape` to single location

✅ **Improved Exception Handling**
- Changed bare `except:` to specific exception types in models.py
- Added proper exception handling in StatsMixedEffectsModel

✅ **Better Organization**
- Separated concerns: UI, models, pipeline, utilities
- Each file has clear responsibility
- Easier to test and maintain

### Remaining Recommendations:
- Consider extracting configuration constants to `config.py`
- Add unit tests for model classes
- Add integration tests for pipeline
- Consider further splitting `pipeline.py` (still 1,454 lines)
